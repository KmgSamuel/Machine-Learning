## About this repository

This is a personal knowledge base for machine learning. I collect what Iâ€™m learning, distill it into concise guides, and keep references handy. Expect:

- ðŸ§­  Clear, purpose-driven writeups
- ðŸ§   Practical patterns and diagrams-as-code
- ðŸ”—  Citations and further reading

---

## Featured

- ðŸ“š Graph Theory & Machine Learning: [docs/graph-theory-llms-agents.md](docs/graph-theory-llms-agents.md)
  - Graphs as a native abstraction, knowledge representation, MCP, multi-agent systems, and inference-time compute.

## Whatâ€™s inside

- Articles in `docs/`
- Links to talks, posts, and libraries I find useful
- Small experiments and patterns I want to reuse
